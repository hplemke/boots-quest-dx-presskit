<h1>Boots Quest DX</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Boots Quest DX is a video game by <a href="#about-discount-realms">Discount Realms</a> (Harrison Lemke). 
It's a humorous, nonviolent adventure game that imagines a goofy children's-book fantasy RPG world where Boots are the only equipment that matters.
It focuses on story, exploration, and environmental puzzle-solving; it's a bit like a point-and-click adventure
but it feels nicer to control. And you can jump.
</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>
Boots Quest was born when a friend told Harrison that they enjoyed a small game he'd made because
"it wasn't like i had to read up on the stats of 17 different kinds of boots
before i started to get anything out of it".
That sounded like a good idea for a game, and Harrison has been working on it ever since.
It's influenced by anti-RPGs like Space Funeral, slow-paced indie exploration games of yesteryear like Knytt,
as well as more obvious touchstones like Dragon Quest, the Legend of Zelda and various LucasArts adventure titles of yore.
